# 🧠 Gamified-CBT-Quest
**Open-Source Gamified Mental Health Support Platform**

> Gamified Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) platform designed to provide free, accessible mental health support for adolescents and students worldwide.

---

## 🌍 Background & Motivation

Globally, nearly **one billion people** experience mental health disorders, and suicide remains a leading cause of death among young people. Adolescents often face depression, anxiety, and behavioral challenges, yet access to affordable, structured mental health support remains limited due to:

- High cost of therapy  
- Social stigma  
- Limited availability of professionals  
- Geographic and infrastructural barriers  

**Gamified-CBT-Quest** bridges this gap through an open-source, interactive digital therapeutic approach for the digital-native generation.

## 💡 The Core Idea: Gamified CBT (GCBT)

Traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is clinically effective but often inaccessible in low-resource settings.  
This project introduces a **computer-based Gamified CBT (GCBT)** system integrating:

### 🧩 Core CBT Principles
- Cognitive restructuring modules  
- Behavioral activation exercises  
- Guided reflections and journaling  
- Mood tracking mechanisms  

### 🤖 Advanced Technology
- Structured rule-based logic  
- Ethical integration of language models (future roadmap)  
- Reinforcement mechanisms for habit formation  

### 🎮 Gamification Elements
- Points & rewards  
- Levels & progression  
- Badges & achievements  
- Avatars & leaderboards  
- Engagement-based milestones  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This platform is a structured self-help support tool based on CBT principles. It is **not** a substitute for professional medical or psychiatric treatment.
